    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
Hi this is my website, it's a little random. I've been running it for some time and over that time I've added stuff. I should really tidy it up and remove the old embarrassing stuff, but I never seem to get round to it.
    </p>
    <p>
I am a Web Developer and Designer, living and working in Devon UK.
    </p>
    <p>
I have recently been trying to put some useful stuff on the site (well trying to!).
